Scenario: you are a university database administrator and you need to create an application to manage student
enrollments and payments

This application should have the following:
 • Ask the user how many students should be added
 • Prompt the user to the name and year of each student
 • Automatically create a 5-digit ID for each student, with the first digit being their year
 • Students can enroll in these courses: History 101, Math 101, English 101, Chemistry 101, Computer Science 101
 • Each course costs $600 to enroll
 • You should be able to view and pay each student's tuition
 • You can view the status of each student, including: name, ID, courses, tuition balance

 For the future:
  • Add a save feature
  • Create GUI interface
